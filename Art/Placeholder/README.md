# Paper-Style Placeholder Guidance

- Trees and props use **2–4 layered sprites**: trunk, canopy, fruit, and optional magical effects.
- Scenes rely on **parallax layers** (sky, mid, ground, foreground) to achieve a faux-3D feel.
- Apply textures using the shared SVG patterns (`paper_fiber_*`, `bark_stripe_soft`, `leaf_vein_subtle`, `fruit_dot_speckle`).
- Keep contrasts readable with soft shadow cutouts and subtle outlines.
- Plan sprite sheets to stay at or below **1024px** per atlas for web performance.
- These assets are placeholders; final art will follow the same paper craft direction without photographic sources.
