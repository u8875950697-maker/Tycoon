# Paper Component Breakdown

## Tree Assembly Layers
1. **Trunk Base:** Flat paper silhouette with subtle grain.
2. **Canopy Layer:** Overlapping leaf shapes with offset shadow.
3. **Fruit Layer:** Raised cut-outs for fruit; animate independently for drops.
4. **Effect Overlay:** Optional glow, aura strips, or particle bursts.

## Animation Notes
- Use hinge-style rotations at the base for sway.
- Harvest events spawn paper scrap particles matching the tree palette.

## UI Integration
- Button states mimic stacked paper cards.
- Shadows remain consistent (down-right offset, 30% opacity).
