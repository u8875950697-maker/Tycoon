## Short-Session Design & Monetization Overview
- Worlds operate as short-form stages with themed biomes and clear completion rewards.
- Tree slots expand gradually within each world, keeping runs readable and strategic.
- Breeding unlocks in later worlds to blend traits for hybrid seeds without overwhelming early play.
- Rewarded ads stay optional, offering double-harvest moments, slot tokens, or brief speed boosts.
- Paper-inspired art direction guides layered, faux-3D presentation for trees and UI.

## Offline/AFK & Welcome-Back Overview
- Offline earnings accrue at 60% of online rates with stage-based hour caps and Prestige multipliers.
- Welcome-back popups highlight time away, resources gained, and offer optional ad or gem doubles for Coins only with strict daily caps.
- Ethical guardrails ensure clear opt-outs, no forced prompts, and respect for short-session pacing.
- Daily streaks and catch-up boosts keep returning players rewarded without encouraging grind.

## Paper-Style Texture Placeholders
- All interim textures rely on shared SVG paper patterns, layered sprites, and parallax depth with no photographic sources.
