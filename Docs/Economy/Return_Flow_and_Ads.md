# Welcome Back Return Flow & Rewarded Ads

## Screen Structure
1. **Header**: "Welcome back!"
2. **Summary block**
   - Time away displayed as `hh:mm`.
   - Resources earned offline: Coins, Mana, Essence, plus Gems if applicable.
   - Highlight "Top tree contributor" with its icon/name for positive feedback.
3. **Call-to-action row**
   - `Collect` (standard, no multiplier)
   - `Collect x2 (Ad)` — doubles Coins only; hidden if ads disabled in config.
   - `Collect x2 (Gems)` — small Gem fee, also doubles Coins only.
4. **Footer notes**
   - "Offline earnings capped at {CapHours} hours. Doubles apply to Coins only."
   - Quick tip reminding players about streak bonuses when active.

## Cooldowns & Limits
- Global rewarded ad cooldown: **10 minutes**.
- Daily ad view cap: **3 per account/device**.
- Offline double (ad or gems) allowed **once per 24 hours**.

## Monetization Guardrails
- Gem spend is optional and balanced for cosmetic/quality-of-life features elsewhere.
- Doubling with Gems here is small, capped, and never mandatory for progression.
- Ads never interrupt mid-action; presented only when returning and always include a clear "No thanks" option.

## Copy Guidelines
- Keep language upbeat and respectful: "Great to see you!" / "Your forest kept growing."
- Avoid FOMO or guilt phrasing.
- Reinforce that players can continue without doubles.
