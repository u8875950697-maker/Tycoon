# Session Tuning

## Target Lengths
- Short burst: **5 minutes**
- Standard run: **10 minutes**
- Extended session: **20 minutes**

## Reward Pacing
- Minute 1: first slot unlock or immediate tree upgrade opportunity.
- Minute 3–5: guarantee chance for the first rare fruit drop.
- Minute 7–10: introduce the first craft buff option (elixir or aura).
- End of run: present a summary screen with two options — Continue or Exit with rewards.

## Multipliers & Caps
- World bonuses scale between +25% and +75% depending on stage difficulty.
- Soft caps prevent runaway stacking so short sessions stay manageable and satisfying.
