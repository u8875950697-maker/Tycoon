# Tree Slots and Grid Layout

## Slot Progression
- Players begin with **3 active slots**.
- Additional slots unlock with Coins for early tiers and optional Gems for later tiers, up to 12 per world.
- Rewarded ad alternative: one slot token per day obtained via opt-in ad view.

## Grid Scale
- Each world uses a compact **4x4 grid** to keep sessions readable and fast.
- Limited scale encourages meaningful placement choices during short runs.

## Slot UI Notes
- Locked tiles display price tags or the token requirement.
- Hover tooltips explain the benefit of unlocking the slot (production increase, synergy space).
- Unlock feedback uses a quick pop animation aligned with the paper-style art direction.
