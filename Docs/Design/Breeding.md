# Tree Breeding System

## Purpose
- Introduce variety within short play sessions without overwhelming complexity.
- Provide light depth for players who want to experiment between worlds.

## Access
- Breeding unlocks in **World 2** (Swamp) after clearing its primary objective once.

## Flow
1. Choose two parent trees from the current world roster.
2. Pay the breeding fee: Coins scaled to parent rarity plus a small Essence cost.
3. Resolve the roll to receive a hybrid seed (guaranteed) with a small mutation chance applied.

## Rarity & Genetics
- Base rarity of the hybrid equals the average of the parent rarity tiers (rounded down).
- **Mutation chance:** 10% to increase the result rarity by one tier, but never above Mythic.
- **Biome alignment bonus:** +5% mutation chance when both parents are native to the current world.

## Inherited Traits
- Fruit yield: low / medium / high tiers.
- Growth speed: slow / medium / fast pacing.
- Ability tag: one of `auto-water`, `auto-harvest`, `aura`, `crit`, `mana-gen`.

## Anti-Grind Guardrails
- Three free breeding attempts per session; afterwards players wait for a cooldown or spend a small Gem fee.
- Hard cap prevents infinite rerolls so short sessions stay rewarding.

## Example Hybrids
- **Lava Ash + Water Birch → Steam Willow:** erupts in short growth bursts after watering.
- **Frost Pine + Dream Willow → Prism Fir:** favors crit-harvest streaks for burst rewards.
- **Shadow Oak + Funkenbaum → Gloom Spark:** combines steady mana with periodic essence trickles.

## UI Notes
- Two parent slots with clear icons.
- Preview panel showing base odds, mutation chance, and resulting trait pool.
- Confirm button leads to a result card reveal animation with the new hybrid seed.
