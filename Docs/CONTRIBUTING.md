# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for supporting Evergrove Tycoon. To keep the project organized during early pre-production, please follow these simple steps:

1. **Plan First:** Discuss major features or asset drops via issues before opening a pull request.
2. **Small PRs:** Keep diffs focused and avoid introducing large auto-generated files or binaries.
3. **Documentation:** Update relevant docs when adding features, art, or workflows so the team stays aligned.
4. **Style Consistency:** Match existing naming conventions and folder structure when submitting new content.
5. **Review Process:** Include testing notes or preview instructions so reviewers can validate changes quickly.

These rules may evolve as the project matures; check back often for updates.
