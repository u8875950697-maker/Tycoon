# Game Design Overview

Evergrove Tycoon focuses on building a magical tree empire through progressive unlocking of biomes, resources, and rare tree species. This document keeps the vision high-level so that future prototypes can follow the original fantasy/management tone without locking the implementation to a specific engine yet.

## Core Pillars
- **Nurture & Harvest:** Caretaking actions such as watering or treating trees should remain central to progression.
- **Magical Economy:** Multiple resource types (coins, mana, essence, gems, seeds, prestige leaves) give players layered goals.
- **Collection & Prestige:** Long-term retention comes from collecting tree variants, cosmetics, and investing prestige loops.

## Experience Goals
- Early game teaches caretaking basics in a calming, readable presentation.
- Mid game adds automation, crafting, and biome variety without overwhelming the player.
- End game introduces mythic trees and prestige loops to keep the economy scaling.

Future design notes can extend this file, but it should stay concise and vision-oriented.
